    <h2>Exercise</h2>
    <div id="problemDescription"><p>Implement a dynamic table of integers that supports the following 4 methods: insertion, deletion, print elements, and reporting the size of the table (both the actual size and the size of the allocated table). <br>When an element is inserted and the allocated table is already full, the size of the allocated table should grow by a factor of 2. When an element is deleted and the size afterwards is 1/4 of the capacity, the size of the allocated table should be halved. The allocated table should always have size at least 1 (ie. when 0 elements are inserted it should still have size 1).</p>


<div><h3>Input</h3><p style="white-space: pre-wrap; font-family: monospace;">Each line: Either "I X" meaning insert X in the table (where X is an integer), 
                  "D" meaning delete the last element in the table,
                  "P" meaning print all elements currently in the table,
                  "S" meaning print the actual size and the size of the allocated table.</p></div>

<div><h3>Output</h3><p style="white-space: pre-wrap; font-family: monospace;">For each "P" in the input, output a line of all elements in the table separated by a whitespace.
For each "S" in the input, output a line with two integers separated by whitespace, namely the actual size (the number of elements in the table) and the size of the allocated table (should always be a power of 2).</p></div>
